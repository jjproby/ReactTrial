###**HELLO**

####This is a personal project for the class _CSC358_

This project was made with the intention to learn how to use ReactJS
The goal is to make a simple web application using ReactJS and learn about open source development

####What does this project **do?**

This project uses the Pokeapi, a database where all (most) pokemon data is stored. 
It is free to use and does not require the use of a API key.

You can visit the website [here!](https://pokeapi.co/)

####How was this made?

The project was first created using the _create-react-app_ method

You can visit their [Github here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

####How does one use this project?

Right now, you run this project usin the command _yarn start_ in your command line.
This does require npm and yarn to be install on your computer

When you download the app, first thing to do is to go to the directory, and run _npm install_
This will install all of the modules that you need to run the app.
You might need _node.js_ to run this project too

If your _npm install_ is successful, then type in _yarn start_ to boot up your localhost
The terminal will take care of it and a window in your browser should open to the app

####Alright, did that, now what?

Now you should see the app! Yay! Now you can type in either a pokemon id number or the name of the pokemon
This will cause the app to search PokeAPI for the data and return it
Right now, the app includes name, id number, abilities, and games the pokemon appeared in
It also displays a sprite of the Pokemon chosen.

And there you have it! That's the app! **Have fun!**
